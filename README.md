# ENCODE Transcription Factor and Histone ChIP-Seq processing pipeline

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2/tree/master)

## Introduction 
This ChIP-Seq pipeline is based off the ENCODE (phase-3) transcription factor and histone ChIP-seq pipeline specifications (by Anshul Kundaje) in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lG_Rd7fnYgRpSIqrIfuVlAz2dW1VaSQThzk836Db99c/edit#).

### Features

* **Portability**: The pipeline run can be performed across different cloud platforms such as Google, AWS and DNAnexus, as well as on cluster engines such as SLURM, SGE and PBS.
* **User-friendly HTML report**: In addition to the standard outputs, the pipeline generates an HTML report that consists of a tabular representation of quality metrics including alignment/peak statistics and FRiP along with many useful plots (IDR/cross-correlation measures). An example of the [HTML report](https://storage.googleapis.com/encode-pipeline-test-samples/encode-chip-seq-pipeline/ENCSR000DYI/example_output/qc.html). The [json file](https://storage.googleapis.com/encode-pipeline-test-samples/encode-chip-seq-pipeline/ENCSR000DYI/example_output/qc.json) used in generating this report.
* **Supported genomes**: Pipeline needs genome specific data such as aligner indices, chromosome sizes file and blacklist. We provide a genome database downloader/builder for hg38, hg19, mm10, mm9. You can also use this [builder](docs/build_genome_database.md) to build genome database from FASTA for your custom genome.

## Installation

1) Git clone this pipeline.
	> **IMPORTANT*: use `~/chip-seq-pipeline2/chip.wdl` as `[WDL]` in Caper's documentation.

	```bash
	$ cd
	$ git clone https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2
	```

2) Install pipeline's [Conda environment](docs/install_conda.md) if you want to use Conda instead of Docker/Singularity. Conda is recommneded on local computer and HPCs (e.g. Stanford Sherlock/SCG). Use 
	> **IMPORTANT*: use `encode-chip-seq-pipeline` as `[PIPELINE_CONDA_ENV]` in Caper's documentation.

3) **Skip this step if you have installed pipeline's Conda environment**. Caper is already included in the Conda environment. [Install Caper](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/caper#installation). Caper is a python wrapper for [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell).

	> **IMPORTANT**: Make sure that you have python3(> 3.4.1) installed on your system.

	```bash
	$ pip install caper  # use pip3 if it doesn't work
	```

4) Follow [Caper's README](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/caper) carefully. Find an instruction for your platform.
	> **IMPORTANT**: Configure your Caper configuration file `~/.caper/default.conf` correctly for your platform.


## Test input JSON file

Use `https://storage.googleapis.com/encode-pipeline-test-samples/encode-chip-seq-pipeline/ENCSR000DYI_subsampled_chr19_only_caper.json` as `[INPUT_JSON]` in Caper's documentation.

## Input JSON file

> **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT BLINDLY USE A TEMPLATE/EXAMPLE INPUT JSON. READ THROUGH THE FOLLOWING GUIDE TO MAKE A CORRECT INPUT JSON FILE.

An input JSON file specifies all the input parameters and files that are necessary for successfully running this pipeline. This includes a specification of the path to the genome reference files and the raw data fastq file. Please make sure to specify absolute paths rather than relative paths in your input JSON files.

1) [Input JSON file specification (short)](docs/input_short.md)
2) [Input JSON file specification (long)](docs/input.md)

## Running a pipeline on DNAnexus

You can also run this pipeline on DNAnexus without using Caper or Cromwell. There are two ways to build a workflow on DNAnexus based on our WDL.

1) [dxWDL CLI](docs/tutorial_dx_cli.md)
2) [DNAnexus Web UI](docs/tutorial_dx_web.md)

## How to organize outputs

Install [Croo](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/croo#installation). **You can skip this installation if you have installed pipeline's Conda environment and activated it**. Make sure that you have python3(> 3.4.1) installed on your system. Find a `metadata.json` on Caper's output directory.

```bash
$ pip install croo
$ croo [METADATA_JSON_FILE]
```
